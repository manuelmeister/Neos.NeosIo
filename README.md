# Neos.NeosIo Rebrand

In a first step we are creating a new [presentational components](DistributionPackages/Neos.Presentation) used for the rebranding of the neos.io website.

## Setup & Installation

Clone the repository, and setup Neos as always:

- Set up Local Beach as described here: https://www.flownative.com/en/documentation/guides/localbeach/local-beach-setup-docker-based-neos-development-howto.html
- Run `composer install`
- Run `beach start`
- Run `beach exec` to enter the container
- Inside the container run `./flow doctrine:migrate` and site imports etc. as needed
- add the following domains:
  - `./flow domain:add --site-node-name neosio --hostname neosio.localbeach.net --scheme https`
  - `./flow domain:add --site-node-name flowneosio --hostname flowneosio.localbeach.net --scheme https`
  - `./flow domain:add --site-node-name neosconio --hostname neosconio.localbeach.net --scheme https`

_Note: We require [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) as well as the `yarn` binary to be installed on your system._

## Building the assets

### Commands

| Command         | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `yarn build`    | Builds all assets                                 |
| `yarn pipeline` | Runs install and then build all assets            |
| `yarn start`    | Watches the sources and rebuilds assets on change |

### Troubleshooting Performance Issues with Neos.IO

If you experience slow website behavior on your machine while using Neos.IO, follow these steps to check for potential solutions:

1. Docker Version: Ensure your Docker installation is up to date. Neos.IO requires Docker version 4.21 or above for optimal performance.

2. VirtioFS Status: Verify if VirtioFS is enabled in your Docker setup. VirtioFS provides improved I/O performance for operations on bind mounts, essential for Neos.IO to perform efficiently.
   * VirtioFS is available in macOS 12.5 and above. Make sure your macOS version meets this requirement. 
   * To enable VirtioFS and the Virtualization framework, check your Docker settings or configuration.

By following these steps, you can potentially address any performance-related issues with Neos.IO and enjoy a smoother website experience.
